[Goal]
join the two raw datasets by season name and team name

[Why]
so that in match stats dataset, an additional information of the final finish position could be added for each team on each season to relate teams' stats with their final performance

[How]
1. extract season year1 & year2(e.g. season 2016/2017 --> year1: 2016, year2: 2017) using excel.
2. replace team name with full team name.
In match stats dataset, team names are in short. The SequenceMatcher library is used to find their full name from EPL table dataset via nearest string distance.
3. joining.
Join the two datasets where team names are the same, and season year1 & year2 are the same
